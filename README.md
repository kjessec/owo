Yet another static site generator.

## Why?
1. I needed to be able to write and publish anywhere, **including on public computers**. Which means I won't generally have `sudo` available, which means I cannot install `npm` modules globally (well I know I can, but won't go through the hassle), so I needed a local one.

* Screw bloated packages that also works as a web server. I intend to only publish to `gh-pages`.

* I plan to write every single post in 2 different languages (English, Korean), yet no static site generators provided me an option to do such thing in the way I wanted.

* I don't need the distinction between `pages`, `posts`, and what not.

* I like to make stuff.
